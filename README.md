Ideas for small programming exercises - hopefully somewhat fun and challenging

This is a (hopefully growing) collection of tiny ideas for programming exercises - most of them should be a bit challenging, meaning that you won't simply *know* how to solve it, 
but you actually have to plan and experiment a bit. There aren't any solutions, the idea is that you pick a challenge, and then try to implement it yourself in the programming
language of your choice - some require text-input as well as output, but a lot can be made with functions simply receiving and returning values, or be expanded to add fancy
visualisations. You decide!

I'll try to categorize the exercises, not based on how "difficult" they are, but on how much they require you to know - if you have just learned about object inheritance, you can
try some of the exercises related to that, but maybe avoid those speficying interfaces until you have learned just a bit more about that. Or you can use the exercises as a motivation
to learn new things.

## Main categories

These are the main catories for exercises - each category will open on its own page, displaying all the exercises fitting into that particular category. Some exercises might appear in several different categories.

* [Strings](strings.md) - involving all sorts of string manipulation, searching and comparison
* [Input](input.md) - reading input from the user, e.g. as text in the terminal
* [Output](output.md) - writing formatted output to the terminal
* [Files](files.md) - reading and writing files in the local filesystem
* [Loops](loops.md) - repetition is the basis of all good exercise, but make them do it on their own
* [Games](games.md) - small, simple games that can be written in a day or less
*
