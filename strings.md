# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, letters, numbers, and symbols. These days mostly encoded with UTF-8, but back in the day often in ASCII.

Every programming language has a large collection of string manipulation functions, but there are always some that are missing - and even if they do exist, it is often fun to create your own implementations! 
Not because you could ever hope to do it better than the language itself, but to learn!

## Requirements
You need to understand strings, and how to get a portion of a string, usually with `.substring`, a single character, eg. with `.charAt`, as well as calculating the length, usually with `.length`.
You probably also need to know how to convert single characters or entire strings to upper or lower-case. Writing your own library implementations is usually a bit more difficult, and you should be familiar
with how to use the functions before writing your own.

### String challenges

Upper / Lower case

* **cap4talize** - write a silly function to capitalize only the fourth letter of a string, so that CAPITALIZE becomes capItalize.
* **capitalize** - use your knowledge to make an actual capitalize function that capitalizes the first letter, so that capITALIZE becomes Capitalize
* **capitalizeName** - write a function that capitalizes every part of a name, so that "haRRy pOTtEr" becomes "Harry Potter", or "harry james potter" becomes "Harry James Potter"
* **capitalizeHyphen** - write a function that capitalizes names, but also understands hyphens, so that "justin finch-fletchley" becomes "Justin Finch-Fletchley"
* **mOckIFysTrINg** - write a function that randomly converts every letter in a string to either upper or lower case
* **camelCase** - write a function that converts a "text with spaces" into a string where every letter after a space is capitalized, and the space is removed: "textWithSpaces"
* 




### Library implementations - more challenging
