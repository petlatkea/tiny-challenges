# Loops

For-loops and while-loops ... making things repeat is one of the most common occurences in programming, in fact computers were invented for speeding up repetetive calculations.
So why not go old-school and build some looping code!
Most of the time loops only makes sense when you have arrays of data, and you 'iterate' through those data, one value at a time. So most looping challenges also includes some form of array

## Tiny arrays
All of these examples are extremely simple, use them as a nice warm-up, or practice to implement the same kind of loop in several different languages.
The arrays are always arrays of numbers, usually integers. Every function should be independent of any other functions, but you might use the solution for one challenge as inspiration for another.

* **findSmallest** - find the smallest number in a list of numbers, make a function that receives an array and returns the `index` of the smallest value in that array
* **findLargest** - you guessed it! Make another function that receives an array and returns the `index` of the largest value!
* **calculateTotal** - this one is very simple, make a function to calculate the total sum of all the values in the array.
* **calculateAverage** - when you know the sum-total, and the number of elements in an array, you can calculate the average value and return it.
* **containsValue** - a function that receives an array and some value, and returns `true` if that value is anywhere in the array.
* **findValue** - now it gets a tiny bit harder, can you find the `index` of a specific `value` in the array? If the value is in the array, return its `index`, otherwise, return `-1` - a value that is *always* an illegal index.
